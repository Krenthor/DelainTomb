        "Part 1: The Smithy The adventure begins at Lars the blacksmith's smithy. Lars is distraught over the disappearance of his daughter, Bess. The adventurers can investigate the area around the smithy to find signs of the goblin patrol. A successful DC 13 Survival/investigation/perception check reveals tracks leading into the nearby Boar Wood.\n",
        "Part 2: Journey Through Boar Wood The adventurers must navigate the dense and dangerous Boar Wood. This journey takes several hours, during which they have a random encounter 1d6, 1= 2 goblins scouts, 2 or 3 = 3 wolves 4-6 1 wild boar non combat. Its night time suggest long rest\n",
        "Part 3: The Approach Two goblins patrol the outside of the tomb, which is set into a hill. Two more goblins stand guard at the entrance.\n",
        "Part 4: The Offering Room Inside the tomb, the first room is an offering room where four goblins are preparing for the ritual. An inscription on the wall reads: \"I swear to fight chaos in all of its forms, to uphold order, by honor of my word.\"\n",
        "Part 5: The Trapped Hallway Beyond the offering room is a crooked hallway with a pressure plate trap that triggers a scythe (1d8 damage). The trap has a DC 13 to spot and disarm.\n",
        "Part 6: Hall of the Oathkeeper The goblin shaman and the  Goblin Warleader   leader reside in the Hall of the Oathkeeper. Two potions of healing can be found on a makeshift altar, and the  Goblin Warleader’s nest contains a few dozen gold pieces and gemstones worth 2d20 + 10 gp. A statue of Delius in this room has an inscription at the base: \"If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me.\" If a character speaks, \"I give my word\" — or anything in that spirit — a secret door leading to the tomb will open.\n",
        "Part 5: Tomb of the Delian Order The secret door leads to the true resting place of the Delian Order. Six sarcophagi bearing the resemblances of the knights they hold are arranged around a larger, more elaborately carved sarcophagus for Lord Delius. A mostly rotted journal on Delius' sarcophagus explains the origin and purpose of the Delian Order. Additional potions of healing are scattered about, left as offerings to the Order long ago.\n",
        "If a character attempts to open a sarcophagus, they will disturb the spirits of the Delian Order. Righteous skeletons will emerge from the sarcophagi to expel the desecrators, unless the character is a Paladin who has sworn the Delian Oath. In that case, they are recognized as a member of the Delian Order, and the treasures of the tomb are theirs by holy right\n",
